				<h2>About Me</h2>

					<img id="profile" src="assets/images/Xavier Oberti.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">

					<p>Xavier Oberti is a rock climbing guru out of Houston, Texas. You wouldn't expect such climbing mastery from an individual out of the flat swampy Texas marshland. Yet, Oberti has traveled the world is his quest for perfection. Basically as good as Alex Honnold and twice as jacked he's expected to make the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. There he'll doubtless leave all rivals in the dust.</p>

					<p>That's not all, Oberti is also a master lifter - out lifting jabronies twice his size. There have been real questions as of late regarding his natty status (Lance was clean right?). The bacney have not deterred is loyalist who claim he's clean and will smoke all competitors his Olympic Weightlifting debut - also expected in 2020. We'll see what comes for the first dual sport olympic athlete in a generation only a few short years from now.</p>
